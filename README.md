## Thermal Analysis:
To enhance thermal performance, heatsinks were added to the LM308N. Various heatsinks were experimented with, and the best results were obtained with heatsink hs7.

## Results and Conclusion:
The thermal analysis revealed that while heatsinks significantly reduced the temperature of the integrated circuit, achieving the optimal operating temperature range specified in the LM308N datasheet was challenging. Despite this, the heatsink demonstrated efficiency in cooling a portion of the IC.
